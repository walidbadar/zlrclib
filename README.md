zlrclib is an open source firmware for requesting lyrics from [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net) 
and displaying them on OLED displays.

The firmware implements a lightweight client for the lrclib.net API, making it possible to fetch time-synced or unsynced lyrics directly from the internet. Lyrics can then be rendered on small displays such as SSD1306 or SH1106-based OLEDs, commonly used in embedded projects.

Built on top of the Zephyr RTOS, zlrclib demonstrates how to integrate networking, HTTP APIs, and text rendering in resource-constrained environments.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper Zephyr development
environment. Follow the official
[Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

### Initialization

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (``workspace``) where
the ``zlrclib`` and all Zephyr modules will be cloned. Run the following
command:

```shell
# initialize workspace for the zlrclib (main branch)
west init -m https://github.com/walidbadar/zlrclib --mr main workspace
# update Zephyr modules
cd workspace
west update
```

### Building and running

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
cd zlrclib
west build -b $BOARD app
```

where `$BOARD` is the target board.

You can use the `zlrclibdk/esp32/procpu` board found in this
repository. Note that Zephyr sample boards may be used if an
appropriate overlay is provided (see `app/boards`).

A sample debug configuration is also provided. To apply it, run the following
command:

```shell
west build -b $BOARD app -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=debug.conf
```

Once you have built the application, run the following command to flash it:

```shell
west flash
```
